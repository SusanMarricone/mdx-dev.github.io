I left my dream job to come work for Vitals.

At least, that's what I thought it was. There had been years of blood, sweat and tears leading up the moment I walked out the door, but the time came where I realized I was not going to be able to make a difference there any longer. I had set out to change the world and while I was doing it, the world changed without me. It was disheartening, to say the least.

When I met the man who would eventually call me to come work for him, I didn't know what Vitals was, or what they were about. As my future boss began to explain to me about how Vitals uses data to essentially make your visit to the doctor smoother and more successful, I caught some of what he was saying, some of it went over my head. But there were two things present in his discussion that I could plainly see: he had passion and he was making a difference. That was something I could be a part of. Something I dearly _wanted_ to be a part of.

This place has a lot of perks. The environment is awesome, the team is great to work with. And then there's the learning. Oh, the _learning!_ At my last job I got to show them what I was all about and how I could make what they had better. At Vitals I'm absorbing so much every day. Here's just a bit of what I've learned while I've been here:

* How to use Git (a really big deal around here)
* How to get comfortable with the terminal again
* Less/Sass
* HAML, which is like wicked-fast markup
* Jekyll, which is the platform this blog is built on
* Started learning some Ruby
* My PHP has gotten better. Sort of.

When I first got here and had lunch with my new coworkers for the first time, one of them said something that still sticks out: "I didn't know a place like this _existed_ in Tulsa."

This blog is really an attempt to change that. We want to show people in our local and professional communities who we are and why we believe in what we're doing and hopefully, you'll come be a part of it.
